LEAKEY is a tool is for validation of leaked API tokens/keys found during pentesting and Red Team Enegagments.<br> 
The script is really useful for Bug Hunters inorder to validate and determine the impact of leaked credentials.

LEAKEY uses a json based signature file located at ```~/.leakey/signatures.json``` <br>
The idea behind LEAKEY is to make it highly customizable and easy to add new services/checks once they are discovered. 

LEAKEY loads the services/check list via the signature file, if you wish to add more Checks/services, simply append it in the ```signatures.json``` file

## Requirements:
* jq

## Installation:
``` curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohsec/LEAKEY/master/install.sh -o leaky_install.sh && chmod +x leaky_install.sh && bash leaky_install.sh```

## Usage:
leaky

## Adding Checks:
All the checks for LEAKEY are defined in the ```signatures.json``` file. <br>To add any new checks, simply appened the signatures file at ```~/.leakey/signatures.json```
```json
{
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Slack API Token",
    "args": [
      "token"
    ],
    "command": "curl -sX POST \"https://slack.com/api/auth.test?token=xoxp-$token&pretty=1\""
  }
```
